# Examples
A collection of frameworks used as a suite of smoke-tests for tauri

These examples are a great way to see how Tauri works with a variety of frameworks.

## How to run 
Ensure that you have read the readme of the example to check that your first-time setup is done.

The examples assume by default that the main Tauri repo is in the root of your drive ( on windows c:/tauri/)

To change an example to be self-contained:
Go to `/%example_path%/src-tauri/cargo.toml`:
and change the dependency 
```toml
tauri = { path = "../../../../../tauri", features = [ "edge" ] }
```
to
```toml
tauri = { version = "*", features = [ "edge" ] }
```
